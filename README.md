# üìò Book Library API

A simple RESTful API for managing a book library, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose).  
This API allows you to create, read, update, and delete books in the library.

## üöÄ Live Demo

You can access the deployed API here (hosted on Render free tier):  
üîó [https://utkrshydv-libraryapi.onrender.com/](https://utkrshydv-libraryapi.onrender.com/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This API is hosted on Render's free tier, so the server may "wake up" slowly after inactivity, and response times may be slower than usual.

* The API base URL is: `https://utkrshydv-libraryapi.onrender.com`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

* Express server code is in `server.js`.
* MongoDB connection is handled in `db.js`.
* Routes are organized in `routes/bookRoutes.js`.
* Static frontend file `home.html` is served from `public/`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Render Free Tier Warning

This API is hosted on Render's free tier plan, which may cause:

* Delays or timeouts when the server "wakes up" after inactivity.
* Occasional slower responses or 502 errors during cold starts.

If you plan to use it heavily or in production, consider upgrading to a paid plan or deploying on a more robust host.
